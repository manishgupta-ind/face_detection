# face_detection
Face Detection Application


We have created a python class face_detection which will take any image as input and it will give following 3 methods to user:

* **get_face_features**: This will print on screen as well as return coordinates, confidence and other features of detected faces in image.

* **image_with_faces**: This method will display image with detected faces.

* **get_faces**: This method will extract and plot each detected face in image separately. It will also return extracted faces from image which can be then passed as input to another system for further processing.
